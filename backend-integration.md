# Backend Integration Analysis

This document analyzes the frontend's requirements for backend endpoints and outlines the necessary API endpoints for full functionality.

## Frontend Components Requiring Backend Interaction

Based on the file structure, the following frontend components require backend interaction to operate with real data:

*   **`src/app/(protected)/admin/page.tsx`**: Administrator dashboard. Requires endpoints for managing users, blog posts, and other site content.
*   **`src/app/(protected)/feed/page.tsx`**: Displays a feed of blog posts. Requires an endpoint to fetch all blog posts.
*   **`src/app/(protected)/postblog/page.tsx`**: Page for creating and editing blog posts. Requires endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting blog posts.
*   **`src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`**: Detail page for a single blog post. Requires an endpoint to fetch a single blog post by its slug and endpoints for managing comments.
*   **`src/app/(public)/contactus/page.tsx`**: The contact form, which has an existing backend endpoint.
*   **`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**: User-specific dashboard. Requires endpoints for user-specific data.
*   **`src/app/profile/page.tsx`**: User profile page. Requires endpoints to get and update user data.
*   **`src/app/settings/page.tsx`**: User settings page. Requires endpoints to get and update user settings.
*   **`src/app/notification/page.tsx`**: Notifications page. Requires an endpoint to fetch notifications for the user.
*   **`src/components/auth/sign-in.tsx` & `src/components/auth/sign-out.tsx`**: Authentication components. Require endpoints for login and logout.
*   **`src/components/blog/comment-section.tsx`**: Comment section for blog posts. Requires endpoints to create, read, update, and delete comments.

## Existing Backend Endpoints

The current backend provides a single endpoint:

*   **`POST /api/contact`**: Sends an email from the contact form.

## Missing Backend Endpoints and Implementation Plan

To connect the frontend to a fully functional backend, the following RESTful API endpoints are missing. This section outlines the required endpoints and provides a basic implementation plan. The following examples will assume the use of a database like PostgreSQL with Prisma as the ORM.

### Authentication

*   **`POST /api/auth/login`**: User login.
    *   **Request Body**: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "password123" }`
    *   **Response**: `{ "token": "jwt_token" }`
*   **`POST /api/auth/logout`**: User logout.
    *   **Implementation**: Invalidate the user's session/token.
*   **`GET /api/auth/session`**: Get the current user session.
    *   **Implementation**: Return the current user's data if a valid session/token exists.

### Users

*   **`GET /api/users`**: Get a list of all users (admin only).
*   **`GET /api/users/{id}`**: Get a single user by ID.
*   **`PUT /api/users/{id}`**: Update a user by ID.
*   **`DELETE /api/users/{id}`**: Delete a user by ID.
*   **`GET /api/me`**: Get the currently logged-in user's profile data.
*   **`PUT /api/me`**: Update the currently logged-in user's profile data.

### Blog Posts

*   **`GET /api/posts`**: Get all blog posts.
*   **`GET /api/posts/{slug}`**: Get a single blog post by slug.
*   **`POST /api/posts`**: Create a new blog post.
*   **`PUT /api/posts/{id}`**: Update a blog post by ID.
*   **`DELETE /api/posts/{id}`**: Delete a blog post by ID.

### Comments

*   **`GET /api/posts/{postId}/comments`**: Get all comments for a blog post.
*   **`POST /api/posts/{postId}/comments`**: Create a new comment for a blog post.
*   **`PUT /api/comments/{id}`**: Update a comment by ID.
*   **`DELETE /api/comments/{id}`**: Delete a comment by ID.

### Notifications

*   **`GET /api/notifications`**: Get all notifications for the current user.
*   **`POST /api/notifications/{id}/read`**: Mark a notification as read.

### Settings

*   **`GET /api/settings`**: Get user settings.
*   **`PUT /api/settings`**: Update user settings.
